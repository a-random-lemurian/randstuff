===< Random Stuff >===============================
A set of apps written in C that output random stuff. At the
moment, only random hex is available.

This project abides by C17 (-std=c17 is one of the compiler
flags used).

===< Compile >===================================
At the moment, this project is source-only, meaning that you must
compile the tools yourself. Simply type 'make' in your terminal,
in the root project directory. Check the bin folder, and then cp
those files to a directory on your $PATH.

Path                   Root user required
/usr/local/bin         yes
~/.local/bin           no
