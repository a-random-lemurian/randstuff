===< Random Stuff >===============================
A set of apps written in C that output random stuff. At the 
moment, only random hex is available.

compile the tools yourself. Simply type 'make' in your terminal,
in the root project directory. Check the bin folder, and then cp
those files to a directory on your $PATH.
