- Added randquote.c to print a random line from a file, such
  as a file containing a list of quotes.
- Added a shell (dash) script to install the binaries in the
  bin/ directory of the project directory to ~/.local/bin.

  the requested ammount of random characters. It defines a
  char array of a fixed size (blksiz internally), fills
  that string with random characters and then supplies it
  to the printf() function.
